# Strategies

## Scaling Strategies

### Use Clustering or a Process Manager

- Run multiple Node.js instances using cluster module or tools like PM2 to utilize all CPU cores.
- This increases parallel request handling on a single machine.

### Use Load Balancing

- Deploy the app behind a load balancer (e.g., AWS ALB, NGINX, or HAProxy).
- Distribute traffic evenly across multiple instances.

### Containerize and Use Orchestration

- Package the app using Docker.
- Deploy on Kubernetes, AWS ECS, or AWS Lambda (for microservices) to auto-scale based on traffic.

### Implement Caching

- Use Redis or in-memory caching to reduce database hits and response times for frequent requests.

### Use a Message Queue

- Use RabbitMQ, Kafka, or SQS for async/background processing (e.g., emails, logging).

### Auto-Scaling Infrastructure

- On AWS, enable auto-scaling groups to spin up/down containers based on CPU/memory.

### Monitor and Alert

- Use tools like Prometheus + Grafana, Datadog, or New Relic to monitor performance and get alerts.

### Stress Test Before Launch

- Run load testing using tools like k6, Artillery, or Apache JMeter to ensure the app performs under load.

## Security Strategies

### User Data Security

- Encrypt sensitive data at rest (e.g., passwords with bcrypt, fields with KMS).
- Use HTTPS (TLS) for all data in transit.
- Apply `strict access control`
- Never store plain-text passwords or secrets â€” always hash and salt.

### API Endpoint Security

- Authenticate users
- Authorize every request
- Rate-limit and throttle requests to prevent abuse (e.g., with API Gateway, Redis, or middleware).
- Validate all inputs to prevent injection attacks (SQLi, XSS).

### Infrastructure Security

- Use VPCs, subnets, and security groups to control network access.
- Enable logging and monitoring
- Perform security audits and penetration testing regularly.
